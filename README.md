# so_long-bonus

Well this is the final form of my little monster game :3
Pretty simple and follows all the rules by 42.
I am not going into the code, so just in order to compile the game and play it you must first clone the repository into your machine, then execute the command "make" for the mandatory part of the game and "make bonus" for the full version, then draw your own map(name must end with .ber) or use any of the maps already included in the file "Maps". In order to play run "./so_long_bonus *path for the map*" and use the keys WASD to move your legend.
enjoy the game and feel free to play with the code in order to change the hero maybe the enemies or other cool stuff.
Edit : I have included minilibx library so anyone can play it withought downloading a thing. enjoy :)
